# Population-Nutrition
This report contains about health,  nutrition and population statistics from 263 countries from 1960 to 2016. My goal is to see how disease prevalence varies among countries based on several indicators such as healthcare coverage, age populations, family dynamics, malnutrition rates etc. 

Many researchers want to figure out what factors determine overall malnutrition in a country. Malnutrition has a loose definition, it can define an underweight or overweight individual, any vitamin, macronutrient and mineral deficiencies to a sever degree. Besides genetic factors, malnutrition is the root cause for most diseases. I want to assess various countries around the world to see what input factors largely` affect their malnutrition rates.

My client could be dietitians, the ADA, or WHO. It's a known fact that Mediterranean countries have a far healthier population than others. If I could get the root of  the reasons as to why countries differ in their malnutrition rates/disease prevalence, it would make the difference in patient education and public health reports.   

The data is acquired from The World Bank, it includes health stats, nutrition and population statistics, reproductive health, health financing, wealth quantiles etc. 

My input variables would consist several factors, such as healthcare, age populations, family dynamics, malnutrition etc in order to assess the output variable of disease prevalence
